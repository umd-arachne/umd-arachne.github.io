<p>Here at Arachne Web Development, you have the option of two layout and design schemes for your customization. Each template has a downloadable .Zip folder of all the files to create that basic look. We have provided commentary within the HTML files to locate and explain the different parts of the code. You may populate these templates with your own content, including text, images, fonts, colors, and even additional web pages. You can start by editing <code>index.html</code> to customize your portfolio homepage.</p>

                alt     ="Carousel Template"
        />
        <p>The Carousel Layout will be heavy in visual content. It will be promoted as the ideal layout options for visual artists like drawers, painters, and photographers. However, anyone can use the template, really.</p>

        <p>The Grid Layout will be heavy in textual content. It will be promoted as the ideal layout options for artists that work primarily with text or sound, like writers and musicians. However, anyone can use the template, really.</p>

<p>All you need to edit HTML and CSS code is a plain-text editor, like Notepad. However, we recommend using a source-code editor with additional features that make the code writing process easier. They often include color coding, tag completion hints, and preview options. Komodo Edit 8 is one source-code editor we recommend.</p>
