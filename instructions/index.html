<p>Having an online portfolio allows you to easily showcase your work, market yourself, and become known as an artist.  By creating your own portfolio, you can create a strong online presence and control the information about you that is available to others. It can also act as an extension of your resume and job applications to potential employers, showing evidence of the skills, qualifications, and talent that you possess. It is also beneficial to have all of your work and professional documents organized in a single place and accessible from virtually anywhere.</p>

<h2 id="how-arachne-web-development-can-help">How Arachne Web Development Can Help</h2>
<p>We are here to support your professional development and talent. Being students at University of Maryland, we saw a need to spread creativity  in the College Park community. By using Arachne Web Development, student-artists (or anyone, really) can easily build their own portfolio and share their creative talent with others. Arachne provides easy-to-use templates and useful, outside resources to make designing and implementing your online portfolio as simple and painless as possible.</p>

<h2 id="the-arachne-user-s-manual">The Arachne User’s Manual</h2>
<p>If you are a student-artist interested in making an online portfolio to showcase your work, Arachne Web Development can get you started! Creating a new website from scratch can be daunting. Fortunately, coding tutorials, portfolio templates, free images, and helpful links are all available right here, ready to use. There are resources here both for those who have never used coding languages, and for those who are already experienced in HTML and CSS web development.
Please refer to our guides below to being creating your online portfolio:</p>

            <p>The HTML code handles the main content of your page, by adding text, images, hyperlinks, rows, and columns. You can edit the code in a program as simple as Notepad. However, we recommend using an actual source-code editor with additional features that make the code writing process easier. They often include color coding, tag completion hints, and preview options. Komodo Edit 8 is one source-code editor we recommend. We provide a detailed tutorial on Komodo Edit 8, if you would like to follow along with our step-by-step instructions.

            <p>The CSS code addresses the visual treatment of your web site, including the background, colors, fonts, special image effects, pop-overs, and much more. You can edit the CSS code in the same code editor you used for your HTML. We recommend using the CSS file provided from Twitter Bootstrap that we annotated for you. Make your edits on a copy, so you always have a back-up. It is also a good idea to only keep the parts of the CSS you are specifically using for your website and deleting the others in order to make validating the code easier later. (Hence, keeping a copy of the original CSS file.)</p>

            <p>You must upload your website to the Web so people not on your computer can also view your new online portfolio. The solution to that problem is using a web host. A web host stores a person’s or organization’s files on its own server and provides the maintenance and networking on behalf of the client. As a student at the University of Maryland, College Park campus, you have access to a web space called TerpConnect. If you are not a UMD student, we recommend the free  web host we are using, called GitHub. On the other hand, you may consider professional web hosting to get your new portfolio more exposure. GoDaddy, for example, is a low-cost professional web host. See  more about web hosting on <a href="step-by-step.html">Step-by-Step</a>.</p>
