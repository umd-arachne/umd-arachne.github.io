Who We Are
--------------------
Arachne Web Development is an online HTML5 resource for artistic students to create, customize, and publish personal portfolios on the Internet. This website and its freeware was all created by a team of students at the University of Maryland during a class project. We hope you have as much fun "weaving your fun" as we did spinning it out!

Its main goals are inspiring creativity, sharing web resources, and ultimately giving student artists the confidence to share their work with the world. Our team believes in “Weaving artists’ and designers’ identities and designs.” With this goal, Arachne Web Development provides you with the tools you need to show who you are as a professional and designer.
