/* ----============== TIPS! ==============--- */
/* The Bootstrap CSS annontated by Arachne Web Development is called, "bootstrap_annotated.css".
* It's a good practice to make CSS files for each page, here "index.css". This will make it easier to track your changes and validate it later.
* (Particularly because Bootstrap has some code that isn't offically approved by the W3C, thus creating a bunch of false validation errors.
* Separate your code so you know what's your error and what's their's.) */

/* --======= Navigation bar =======--*/
/* As you can see, there's a lot of code that goes into a nav bar. Fortunately, here are the parts that mostly concern you.
To customize the appearance of your nav bar, you add several "classes," or groups of settings. The code will look like this:
    <div class="header">
      <ul class="nav nav-pills pull-right">
          <li class="active"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="link1.html">Link 1 in your Nav Bar</a></li>
          <li><a href="link2.html">Link 2 in your Nav Bar</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
The nav bar in this example uses settings from multiple "classes" and therefore lists three: "nav," "nav-pills," and "pull-right."
"Nav" just refers to the bare-bones settings of a navigation bar, like underlining the hyperlinks.
"Nav-pills" refers to a button-like appearance.
"Pull-right" just pulls the entire group of links to the right-hand side of the screen.
You're not limited to these classes, though. You can change looks (tabs, pills) and positioning (stacked, fixed) too. Go back to the Table of Contents for a list of classes, or browse them below. */

.nav {
  padding-left: 0; /* Nav bar is flush left. */
  margin-bottom: 15px; /* This adds a buffer zone between the bottom of your nav bar and the top of your content. */
  list-style: none;
}


/* ---======= Nav bar, hover effects =======--- */
/* This part changes how your list of links will look when a user's mouse moves across. */
.nav > li > a:hover,
.nav > li > a:focus {
  text-decoration: none;
  background-color: #faf6c6;
}

/* This part changes how your list of links will look when a user opens a menu in the nav bar. */
.nav .open > a,
.nav .open > a:hover,
.nav .open > a:focus {
  background-color: #faf6c6; /* yellow */
  border-color: #08b3bd; /* blue */
}


/* ---======= Nav bar, pill look =======--- */
/* In this context, "pills" are like buttons that specifically go around your main navigation hyperlinks. You will need to add a class to the HTML code, called "nav-pills."
For an example of classes in context, Find (ctrl+F) "Navigation Bar."*/

/* Change color of pill with active page.*/
.nav-pills > li.active > a,
.nav-pills > li.active > a:hover,
.nav-pills > li.active > a:focus {
