        <!-- ============ About the "ABOUT" page ========================
    The "ABOUT" page is unique in that it uses a combination of our two layout options: 
    both the default, full-width layout, as well as a grid system. 

    As an exception, the "ABOUT" page's grid system uses thirds (instead of fourths), so 
    that no Team Bio appears alone.

    We feel it is important to keep our Team Bios for two reasons:

        1.  Many professional websites have contact information for department heads, company founders, etc.
            We are the "founders" of Arachne Web Development, and therefore, our Team Bios are appropriate.

        2.  Many artist portfolio websites have a section for that artist's bio and profile. Since Arachne
            is emulating that aesthetic and setting a model for the student-artists using our website, we
            again feel that our Team Bios are appropriate.

            <h2>The Origins of Our Name</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-sm-5">The inspiration for the web development project comes from Roman mythology, but it holds modern day appeal to an artistic audience. “Arachne” was a mortal peasant woman who was the best weaver in the world. Her boastfulness caused the goddess of weaving, Minerva, to challenge her to a weaving contest. Arachne technically “won” her tapestry was the best.</p>
                <p class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-1">In a jealous rage, Minerva struck her. Then, Minerva only transformed Arachne into a spider as a lifelong punishment for her pride. Arachne’s story provided a message to artists. She produced great art, though at great sacrifice. Young artists can relate to the story, given the modern day challenges to produce beautiful artwork and make a living off of that artistic passion.</p>
